RTA GovHack 2014

This project showcases the current rental market within the state of Queensland. By showing the previous nine months of new bonds commencing, registered with the Queensland Residential Tenancies Authority, the system allows users to investigate the rental market around them.

People are able to see for each suburb, the different number of new rentals that commenced in the last nine months, statistics on the weekly rental price and the different types of properties that make up the suburb. By presenting the new rentals over the nine month period, users are able to see when there is a large amount of change occurring in suburb. This allows them to identify potentially when is the best or worst time to consider moving to a new suburb. It also identifies what the average rental value is within the suburb for the month so tenants and owners can see if they are getting the better end of the deal.
